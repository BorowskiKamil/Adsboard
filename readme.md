The goal of this project is just a showcase of one of many approches to microservices in .NET. It's written in .NET Core 2.2 with communication over RabbitMQ.

### How to use:

### Used technologies:
- ASP.NET Core 2.2
- ASP.NET WebApi Core
- Entity Framework Core 2.2
- RawRabbit
- AutoMapper
- FluentValidation
- MySQL
- Polly
- RestEase
- Swagger
- Docker

### Architecture
- Asynchronous communication across internal microservices
- Retries with exponential backoff
- DDD (Domain Driven Design) fundamentals
- CQRS
- Integration events

### Disclamer
This project uses a lot of architecture implementations that might be over-engineering for such a small project. Beware, it's not a definitive solution and production-ready code.
