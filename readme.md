# Adsboard üìã
The goal of this project is just a showcase of one of many approches to microservices in .NET. It's written in .NET Core 2.2 with communication over RabbitMQ.

### How to use:
The recommended way of running this project is using üê≥ docker compose. You can find compose files [here](https://github.com/BorowskiKamil/Adsboard/tree/master/Adsboard/compose) and run them directly from this folder in following order:
```
docker-compose -f mysql-rabbitmq-redis.yml up
docker-compose -f services.yml up
```
It's required to run both of commands. By executing first one you'll run dependencies, infrastructural services like mysql, rabbitmq and redis. Second command runs project's services.

There's also possibility to run services by going to particual service's project and executing ```dotnet run``` in ```src/[PROJECT_NAME]```.

### Disclamer
